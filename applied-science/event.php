					<p>The Department of First-Year Engineering includes multidisciplinary faculty from the Applied Sciences and Humanities. First-Year Engineering was founded in 2014 with the mission of addressing basic Sciences, Programming, Mathematics, Basic Engineering Subjects, Life skills, Language and Communication Skills, and Environmental studies to help students for analyzing problems related to engineering and society.<br><br>
						The Applied Sciences and Humanities courses in the first year develop skills, innovations, professional skills and interpersonal skills enhanced with intellectual skills of engineering. The department believes in developing the core competencies through hands-on activities. Project-based learning is a regular part of the curriculum that happens in collaboration with the industry professionals and their presentations have been a motivation for the students to grow skilled. The teaching learning process includes multi disciplinary faculty who adopt innovative pedagogy and application of knowledge.<br><br>
						The department has state of the art laboratory resources and a library catering to subjects such as Engineering Physics, Engineering Chemistry, Engineering Mathematics, Basic Electrical Engineering, Systems in Mechanical Engineering, CAD-CAM and Computer Laboratories. The course is a precursor to the specializations in the later years. The students grow holistically with regular co-curricular activities related to spirituality, meditation, yoga, sports, group discussions, literary club activities, photography, painting, sketching, music, dramatics and others. The students learn to collaborate, work in teams, think on critical issues, make decisions, and solve problems creatively during the applied sciences and humanities sessions. It brings out the best in the students before they step into their core strengths and domains. Students begin establishing ties with the community and industry through numerous field trips, collegiate and intercollegiate events and services.
