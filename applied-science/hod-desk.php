						<p>The goal of the Department of First Year Engineering is to introduce students to the field of engineering by means of introductory courses in electrical,
							mechanical, civil, electronics and computer engineering. The basic knowledge from various streams of engineering help in developing ‘interdisciplinary
							approach’ needed in every walk of life. The department also trains the students in basic sciences of physics and chemistry and techniques of mathematics
							which are the foundation stones for all the subjects and which give them analytical tools to quantify problems, their solutions and understand, resolve
							issues in real life.<br><br>
							Our team of dedicated faculty constantly strives to impart quality education and develop the engineering skills, knowledge and confidence
							among the students so as to equip them to flourish in their chosen domains in life. The foundation stones and the building blocks of their professional career
							are laid here by the team with a zeal and passion which is unparalleled. A disciplinary approach is also employed with respect to close monitoring of the
							student’s academics and self-improvement.<br><br>
							This helps the institute track academic performance, analyze and improve it with a great feedback system. The department has well furnished class rooms
							and laboratories with state of the art instruments as a part of continued focus on infrastructure needs of changing times.
							The department takes extra efforts and supports the promotion of curricular and co-curricular activities of students which form the basis of overall development of the students.
